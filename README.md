# PythonDormsProject
This is an application that manages information about student dorms.
The app takes a application nr, a student name, and their desired dorm.
First, the app displays all of the applications; 
then, it uses a function to show only the students that have an application number greather than a set number
;lastly, it sorts the name of the students.
I used a repository to manage all the information.
